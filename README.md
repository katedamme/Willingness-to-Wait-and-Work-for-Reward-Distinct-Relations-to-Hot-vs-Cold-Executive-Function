# Willingness-to-Wait-and-Work-for-Reward-Distinct-Relations-to-Hot-vs-Cold-Executive-Function
This repository includes a collection of MPlus and R scripts used to set up the structural equation modeling described in KSF Damme et al., 2018 (under review)
# This Code was applied to data in the BrainMAPD behavioral project and was used to assess willingness to work (EEfRT) at three levels of reward probability
# in relationship to negative and neutral affective funtion. 
# This is intended to be a tool for transperancy and replication purposes and does not represent any new code.
